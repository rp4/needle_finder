## Detection Method Cheat Sheet

### Quick "What to Use When" Reference

| Anomaly Type | Detection Methods | When to Use |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Single column weird values** | Robust z/MAD, IQR | Individual metrics outside normal range |
| **Weird combos** | Isolation Forest, PCA/autoencoder error | Multiple features create unusual pattern together |
| **Over time** | Forecast-then-flag residuals; CUSUM/change-point | Temporal patterns, trends, or sudden changes |
| **Inside a segment** | Score vs segment baselines; LOF per segment | Outliers within peer groups |
| **Group vs groups** | Divergence tests (MMD/energy distance), control charts | Entire group behaves differently than others |
| **Sequences/sessions** | Windowed features + HMM/LSTM; run-length stats | Pattern in transaction order or timing |
| **Graphs** | Node/edge embeddings → outlier score; community anomalies | Network relationships and connections |
| **Drift** | PSI/KS for inputs; monitor model loss/metrics | Distribution changes or model degradation |

### AI Agent Integration Points

For each detection method, the AI agent will:
1. **Pre-process**: Run the appropriate detection algorithm
2. **Contextualize**: Add business context to statistical findings
3. **Prioritize**: Rank by business impact, not just statistical score
4. **Explain**: Generate natural language explanations
5. **Recommend**: Suggest investigation steps

### Visualization Mapping

| Detection Output | Visualization Type | AI Enhancement |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Z-scores/MAD scores | Range Ruler, Outlier Island | "This value is X standard deviations from normal" |
| Isolation scores | Combination Lock, Social Spider Web | "This pattern occurs in 0.01% of cases" |
| Forecast residuals | Heartbeat Monitor, Slope Shifter | "Expected $X but saw $Y - investigate the difference" |
| Segment baselines | Hot Zone Map, Outlier Island | "Unusual for this customer segment" |
| Distribution distances | Shape Shifter | "Customer mix has shifted by X%" |
| Sequence probabilities | Flow Checker, Speed Trap | "This sequence has never occurred before" |
| Graph metrics | Cluster Detector | "Unusually connected - possible coordination" |
| Drift scores | Rule Evolution | "Model accuracy dropped - retraining needed" |
